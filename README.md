## Week 3: Polars Descriptive Statistics Script

### Goal of the project:
Write a Python script that practices Exploratory Data Analysis on a dataset using Polars Library

### Report
* Please check more information about the dataset at READ.md for mini-project-2
* Please check the scatter plot 

### Takeaways
* I used AI to translate my code from Pandas directly to Polars. However, I found since the ChatGPT was only trained on data till 2021 when the latest Polars at that time was 0.9, but I wanted to use the current latest version of Polars, which is 0.19, I got error when adding new column to my data, and I have to manually change the syntax. When we use AI on fast growing coding language or libary, there is this shortcoming that
* But I was still able to use 
* For my project written in Pandas, I used pandas scatter plot function `df.plot.scatter`. But Polars does not have buil-in data visualizaiton feature, so I have to install another library Seaborn to do the plotting. Although Polars is faster than Pandas,
